# Nya
Fork of a Beat Saber mod for displaying nya-tastic images from various anime themed web APIs

Now including my own xSky API!

## Installation
Download the latest version of Nya from [releases](https://github.com/xskyyy/Nya/releases) and slap it into your BeatSaber's plugin folder.

Nya requires BSML and SiraUtil, which can both be found in ModAssistant.

## Supported web APIs
* [Waifu.Pics](https://waifu.pics/)
* [Nekos.Life](https://nekos.life/)
* [xSky API](https://api.xsky.dev/)
* Local Files *(Not really a web API but I may as well list it)*

### Local Files
In order for local files to work there must be compatible images in the sfw / nsfw files found in Nya's UserData folder.
The compatible file types are PNG, JPEG, GIF and APNG.
Images which are downloaded via Nya will also be placed in the sfw / nsfw folders.
